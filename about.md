# Hi I'm Jeff.

<img src="/img/about_me.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>


I am woking as a [Research Associate](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/830506-jefferson-paril) in the [Adaptive Evolution Lab](https://adaptive-evolution.biosciences.unimelb.edu.au/) in the University of Melbourne.

I am broadly interested in elucidating the genetic underpinnings and evolution of quantitative traits in agriculture and ecology.
