The [Bulmer effect](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/282718) is the reduction in the additive genetic variance of a highly polygenic trait after every generation under directional selection. This effect is entirely due to the correlation between pairs of loci as a result of linkage (physical proximity) or random associations.
