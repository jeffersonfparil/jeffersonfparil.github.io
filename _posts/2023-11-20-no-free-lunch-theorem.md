# No free lunch theorem

[2023-11-20]

The no free lunch theorem states that there will never be a **best optimisation algorithm**, i.e. a one-size-fits-all algorithm that outperforms all other algorithms across all possible optimisation problems. 
In other words, all possible optimisation algorithms will on average, perform equally well across all possible problems.
