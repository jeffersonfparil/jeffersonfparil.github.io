# Fst

[2021-01-08]

In simple terms, Fst measures the ratio between the observed heterozygosity (Ho) and the expected heterozygosity (He).

The expected heterozygosity can be computed following the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle, e.g. for a biallelic locus this is `2p(1-p)` where p is the frequency of one of the alleles.

On one extreme, if the ratio between observed and expected heterozygosities in a population is zero, i.e. `Ho/He = 0`, then this means that the individuals or subpopulations are not intercrossing (i.e. assortative mating and/or selfing and/or asexually reproducing). Hence the population is said to be highly structured. In terms of Fst:
```
Fst = 1 - (Ho/He).
```
Therefore, if `Ho/He = 0` then `Fst = 1`, which means highly structure populations.

On the other extreme, a population with `Ho/He =  1` or `Fst = 0`, means that the individuals or subpopulations are intercrossing freely as if they were a single panmictic population, hence the population is said to have no structure.
