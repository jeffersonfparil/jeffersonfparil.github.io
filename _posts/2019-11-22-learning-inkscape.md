Learning curve is a bit steep but the amount of control it offers is just tremendous!

The essential ideas that got me started are:

- shapes, lines, nodes and paths
- layers and opacity (transparency)
- clipping (cropping)

Also [ColorBrewer2](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) is a good place to get nice color palettes.
