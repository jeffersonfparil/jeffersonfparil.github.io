[Violinplotter version 2](https://github.com/jeffersonfparil/violinplotter) is out with the option to:

- plot sample size of 1 as a point,
- append sample sizes, and
- include or exclude specific error bars.

Plus a quick fix (parsing explanatory variables) is on-track to be released as [version 2.0.1](https://github.com/jeffersonfparil/violinplotter).
