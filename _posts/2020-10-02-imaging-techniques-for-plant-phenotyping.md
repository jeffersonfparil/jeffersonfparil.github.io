An illustration of the different imaging techniques used to extract **colorimetric** and **spatio-tomographic** information from plants. **Colorimetric information** are predictors of the concentrations or densities of various plant-associated substances, e.g. water, chlorophyll, and starch. **Spatio-tomographic** information describes the external and internal morphologies of plant cells, tissues, organs and whole plants.
