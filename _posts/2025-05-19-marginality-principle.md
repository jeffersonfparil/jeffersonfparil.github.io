In a linear mixed model framework, the [marginality principle](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfae/10962545/3d6db66bd415/BIMJ-65-0-g001.jpg) applies only to the fixed effects, simply because of the way the **_X_** matrix is defined, i.e. via *dummy encoding* with 1 less factor level or *df = p-1* per factor. Excluding the main effects when the interaction effect is included makes it impossible to extract all the effects of the interaction term.
