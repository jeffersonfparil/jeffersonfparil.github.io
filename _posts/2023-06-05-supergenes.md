A supergene is a set of multiple tightly linked genes co-regulating a complex/polygenic trait. Supergenes are the simplification or discretization of polygenic traits into pseudo-monogenic traits. This genetic architecture facilitates local adaptation by enabling the selection for discrete, locally adapted phenotypes. It also promotes rapid adaptive evolution by enhancing the efficacy of selection, where the combined effects of multiple genes contained within a supergene leads to a more substantial impact on the organism's phenotype than individual genes. This genetic architecture provides a possible avenue through which species can adapt quickly to climate change. Furthermore, synthesising this genetic architecture presents a promising avenue to efficiently manipulate complex traits in agroecological species, particularly crop yield heterosis. Supergenes are arguably underappreciated and understudied despite its significance in evolutionary biology and its potential paradigm-shifting applications in agriculture. Knowledge gaps exist regarding the prevalence and distribution of supergenes in nature, their evolution, and their potential application in crop breeding.
