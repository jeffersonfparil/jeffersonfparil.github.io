In a linear mixed model framework, the [marginality principle](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfae/10962545/3d6db66bd415/BIMJ-65-0-g001.jpg) applies only the fixed effects, simply because of the way the **X** matrix is defined, i.e. *dummy encoding* with 1 less factor level or *df = p-1*. Excluding the main effects when the interaction effect is included makes it impossible to extract all the effects per combination.
