I came across [this article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fflorentcrivello.com%2Findex.php%2F2019%2F09%2F04%2Fthe-efficiency-destroying-magic-of-tidying-up%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFdADMp8KtjxkiyNFXJS-w5BQyfPA) on [hacker news](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNElUeeEwQPcMOIArURtohCsN6AksA) and thought it was an interesting take on design philosophy. I do not agree with the main point of the article - that orderliness does not equate to efficiency. However I agree that different design principles may be apt  for different circumstances.

My design principle is: make it simple but redundant, with as little moving parts as possible. I try to apply this to my projects but I often fail due to time constraints and rendered moot by my other design principle: just make the damned thing work first and then optimize.
