# Who are you and what do you do in the School?

- Iâ€™m Jeff Paril, a research associate in weed genomics in the adaptative evolution lab working with Alex Fournier-Level.
- I also had a short but fun 6-month foray with Ben Phillips as a Post-doc researcher where we chased suppression gene drives in space using simulations which we are currently trying write-up our results

# What problem are you trying to solve with your research?

- With the gene drives project we found that the new and exciting application of CRISPR to eradicate (or control) pest and invasive populations such as the dengue- and malaria-carrying mosquitoes or cane toads need to account for the spatial disperions capabaility of these noxious species, because these suppression drives in theory can be very effective can fail with high probability due to chasing, i.e. the drive indefinitely chase the population it's trying to eradicate because it's fast or go through it

- With the weedomics project we want to bring herbicide resistance assays for weeds into the 21st century using genomics and genomic prediction
- This has the potential to improve not only the accuracy of the assays but also the speed and throughput

- Theoretical science: mapping genotypes with phenotypes
- Applied science: population control
- The basic question of genetics: How do we predict an individual's phenotype using it's genotype?
- Ecologically and agriculturally relevant topic of population control, i.e. invasive species in ecology and pests in agriculture: How do we control if not totally eradicate these noxious populations in areas we do not want them to be in?

I try to dabble in the basic question in genetics, which is how do we predict the phenotype, i.e. the physical, morphological, biochemical or any observable chracteristic of an individual - be that an animal, plant or any living thing, using its genotype, i.e. the sequence of bases A, T, C, and G in its DNA. Specifically, I use statistical techniques to predict the levels of resistance of an agricultural pest in paddocks of wheat, barley, canola, bean, etc, a weed called ryegrass to herbicides. Farmers try to get rid of them from their fields because they can reduce their crop yields and they also cause hay fever. They use herbicides, i.e. specially formulated concoctions to kill these weeds with nill to minimal non-target effects on the environment. However, these weeds are craftly slippery little buggers! They're evolving right in front of our eyes, by developing resistance over decades of herbicide application!

# What skills do you bring to bear on these problems?

- I try to balance experimental and theoretical work.
- Greenhouse experiments, field samplings, wet lab experiments, and computational/in-silico experiments work

# Do you have any outlandish stories from your time here at Unimelb?

- There were very smart mice in the old glasshouses before the rennovation.
- I hope they found a new home not in the new glasshouse complex.

# Do you have any advice for current students?

- focus on what's fun for you
- fun as in keeps you motivated
