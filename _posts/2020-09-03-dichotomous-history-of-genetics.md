The history of genetics, specifically the inextricably intertwined fields of evolution, population and quantitative genetics have always had a tumultuous and interesting history dominated by the colourful personalities of giants in the field.

An unexpectedly entertaining read of the "The origins of theoretical population genetics" by Provine (2001) is a good account of this, including Charlesworth & Charlesworth's 2017 Heredity article: "Population genetics from 1966 to 2016".

Funny note:
“Dick’s ‘sermon’ began by stating that ‘our field is divided into two warring sects. These are the adherents to the Epistle of St. Sewall to the Japanese, who believe that the race is not to the swiftest nor the battle to the strong ... but time and chance happeneth to them all, and the followers of St Ronald, who believe that many are called but few are chosen.’" (from Charlesworth, B. & Charlesworth, D. Population genetics from 1966 to 2016. Heredity 118, 2–9 (2017))
