# Cooperation in Science

This struck me: 
```
“A lot of our training is like this: we learn how to do things that contribute in a very small way to a much larger mission but do absolutely nothing for our own career prospects.” (cooperation)
```
This quote is from a blog quoting Chris Hadfield's book An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. This mindset (or mental model according to the blog) readily applies to our scientific careers: much of what we do may not lead to publications or patents or recognition or a Nobel Prize (but probably an Ig Nobel Prize)\*; but will contribute to scientific knowledge nonetheless.
