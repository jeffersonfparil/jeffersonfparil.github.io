Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis via bridge amplification on a lawn of oligonucleotides using fluorescent reversible terminator dNTPs. Panel A: attachment of the adapter ligated DNA into the surface of the flowcell. Panel B: bridge amplification. Panel C: Clusters of clonal DNA. Panel D: Fluorescence emission in a cluster following laser excitation after DNA polymerase activity using primers and four reversible terminator dNTPs. Panel E: simultaneous fluorescence emissions from multiple clusters. Panel F: fluorescence image across the whole flowcell is captured for every cycle.
