# Who are you and what do you do in the School?

- Iâ€™m Jeff Paril, a research associate in weed genomics in the adaptaive evolution lab working with Alex Fournier-Level.
- I also had a short but fun 6-month foray with Ben Phillips as a Post-doc researcher where we chased suppression gene drives in space using simulations which we are currently trying write-up our results

# What problem are you trying to solve with your research?

- With the gene drives project we found that the new and exciting application of CRISPR to eradicate (or control) pest and invasive populations such as the dengue- and malaria-carrying mosquitoes or cane toads need to account for the spatial disperions capabaility of these noxious species, because these suppression drives in theory can be very effective can fail with high probability due to chasing, i.e. the drive indefinitely chase the population it's trying to eradicate because it's fast or go through it

- With the weedomics project we want to bring herbicide resistance assays for weeds into the 21st century using genomics and genomic prediction
- This has the potential to improve not only the accuracy of the assays but also the speed and throughput

# What skills do you bring to bear on these problems?

- I try to balance experimental and theoretical work.
- Greenhouse experiments, field samplings, wet DNA extraction, and computational/in-silico experiments work

# Do you have any outlandish stories from your time here at Unimelb?



# Do you have any advice for current students?

- focus on what's fun for you
- fun as in keeps you motivated
